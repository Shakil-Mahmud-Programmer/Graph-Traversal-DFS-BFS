# Graph-Traversal-DFS-BFS
Graph traversal with DFS and BFS technique in Python. Here distance of each traversing node from root node will be come out as output. This code will generate a graph as shown in the picture below then it will traverse the graph with DFS and BFS.
You can edit in code graph as you wish with a valid way.
